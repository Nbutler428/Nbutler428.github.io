## About Me

I'm a data science graduate student passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights that support the public good. With hands-on experience in technical support, clinical research, and real-time data engineering, I thrive at the intersection of technology and real-world impact.

I’m especially drawn to environments where collaboration, curiosity, and mutual respect are core values. Places that prioritize thoughtful communication and empower teams to grow together. Whether it's building ETL pipelines or consulting on statistical models, I enjoy work that’s both intellectually challenging and socially meaningful.
