## About Me

I'm a data science graduate student passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights that support public good. With hands-on experience in technical support, clinical research, and real-time data engineering, I thrive at the intersection of technology and real-world impact. I’m especially drawn to environments where collaboration, curiosity, and mutual respect are core values — places that prioritize thoughtful communication and empower teams to grow together. Whether it's building ETL pipelines or consulting on statistical models, I enjoy work that’s both intellectually challenging and socially meaningful.
