#  Alumni Giving Behavior Analysis at Juniata College

## Summary

This project analyzed donation patterns among alumni athletes at Juniata College, focusing on trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The team evaluated engagement categories (like Loyal, LYBUNT, SYBUNT), seasonality of giving, and differences in donation size and frequency across funds, sports, and time periods.

---

## Goals

- Determine whether alumni engagement level is dependent on sport played
- Explore whether contribution amounts or counts vary pre/post-COVID
- Identify which funds and months attract the most donations
- Understand engagement category distribution across sports

---

## Methodology

- Used R for statistical testing, visualizations, and data wrangling
- Categorical data tested using **Chi-Square test**
- Average contribution size tested with **t-tests** and **Kruskal-Wallis** + **Dunn’s post hoc** for fiscal year comparisons
- Analysis focused on contributions made over the **last five fiscal years**

---

## Key Insights

- **Most common category**: Non-Donor (2,331 alumni)  
- **Least common**: Loyal Donors (484 alumni)
- A Chi-Square test showed **alumni engagement level is statistically dependent on sport played** (p < 0.05)
- Fundraising peaked in **April and December** post-COVID, while **December dominated pre-COVID**
- **Women's Soccer** had the lowest average gift size ($40.87), while **Golf** had the highest ($1,489.38)
- Fiscal year **2020–2021** had significantly different contribution patterns vs. prior years (via Dunn test)
