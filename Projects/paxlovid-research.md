#  Paxlovid & Dysgeusia Research

## Summary

This project explored whether Paxlovid — a COVID-19 treatment made of Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir — causes dysgeusia (taste distortion). As a research intern at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, I helped design and conduct sensory tests, analyze clinical findings, and present conclusions on the likely causes of Paxlovid-related dysgeusia.

---

## Objectives

- Determine if one or both components of Paxlovid contribute to dysgeusia
- Measure intensity and frequency of taste distortion using participant data
- Explore the interaction of protease inhibitors with bitter taste receptors

---

## Methods

- Conducted taste-intensity testing using Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir solutions
- Used 5% ethanol as a solvent for better dissolution and taste delivery
- Repeated testing with altered solution order to eliminate ordering bias
- Collected both group-level and individual-level intensity data

---

## Results Summary

- **Nirmatrelvir** and **combination solutions** caused higher average taste intensity than Ritonavir alone
- No significant correlation between sample order and perceived intensity
- Taste differences were attributed to molecular interaction with bitter receptors (especially **TAS2R7**)

## Insights

- Nirmatrelvir appears to be the dominant contributor to dysgeusia
- Taste effects align with known activation of TAS2R7, a bitter taste receptor
- Solutions had quantifiable, reproducible intensity differences across participants
